## Working Paper

### "What Assets Should the Central Bank Purchase in a Quantitative Easing Program" (Job Market Paper), with Francisco Ruge-Murcia
Abstract: This paper develops a multi-sector DSGE model to study if different asset purchasing produces different sectoral effects in a quantitative easing program.  Sectors that construct an input-output network are heterogeneous in production technology, price stickiness, and agency costs. We then evaluate the sectoral effect in a calibrated 2-sector economy. We find the heterogeneity in agency cost is the primary factor determining the effect of quantitative easing. Heterogeneous price stickiness and external funding constraints also induce different sectors responses. For the central bank, choosing the assets purchased in QE faces a trade-off between short-run stimulus and medium-run deterioration.
